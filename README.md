# Sound Sampler
What about turning your cellphone into a drum machine, or even a synthetizer? Need a device to quickly trigger sounds during a presentation or while recording a podcast? 

Sound Sampler is the tool you were looking for. It's an easy to configure and fully customizable JavaScript Web App. Play samples direct from your browser. No installation needed.

8 sample positions can be  triggered by keys (1-8) or by clicking on the color icons. Needs more positions? Just edit the HTML and CSS and voila.

Add your own samples to the "samples" folder and edit the links in the HTML <audio>tags. You can also link to sample files in online repositories. 

To change the triggers in your keyboard, check https://keycode.info/ for each keycode.
